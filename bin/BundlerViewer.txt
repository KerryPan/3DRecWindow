Keyboard shorcut:
-----------------

+ : show next camera 
- : show previous camera
O : increase point size (point cloud)
P : decrease point size (point cloud)
space : switch dense/sparse point cloud
C : toggle camera plane visibility

You can move using arrow key and ZQSD(Azerty) and mouse.

Note:
-----
To enable the dense point cloud mode you have to generate it using CMVS/PMVS2.
Then you have to open it (.ply file) using meshlab and save it in binary mode.
Then you have to move the file to "your_folder/pmvs/models/mesh.ply"
